# PHP and JS Test
A php and js test that was completed for a job. I got an offer because of this.
Read the requirements first to understand why some things aren't best practice e.g. scripts.js file.

# Requirements
## PHP Challenge:

Your goal is to generate a PHP script that utilizes an object oriented approach to do the following:

* Create a base animal class that contains a serial number property 
* Create the following child classes "goat" and "sheep"
* Generate 100 unique and random prime numbers from 0 to 10,000. Attribute each "serial" prime number to a baby goat, and store in file goat.txt.
* Generate serial numbers using the same method for sheep, and save in sheep.txt.
* Find all instances where the serial numbers assigned to goat and sheep are equal and save these serials to a new file called soulmates.txt.
* Output to screen: interesting facts about each set of serial numbers generated (ie. average sum, mean, . get creative)

## JavaScript Technical Evaluation

Build a mini address book to showcase your JavaScript and DOM talents. Objectives:

* The app will consist of a <select multiple> html element to list contacts
* Create input elements so that the user can add a valid 'name' and a 'telephone' value for a new contact and an 'add' button which adds contact to list
* Contact information in each select <option> tag can be displayed in anyway you like
* Once contacts exist in the multi - select element, the user should be able to select and press a 'delete' button to remove multiple at a time
* Add buttons to sort contacts by name and telephone number

Bonus:

* Use additional fields aside from name and telephone and allow sorting on them, ie: last name, email, etc...
* Use native JavaScript to generate all DOM elements
* Minimize/eliminate use of JQuery - this test is meant to evaluate your core JavaScript skills without relying on frameworks such as jQuery
* Write your app in an object - oriented approach - define object properties and use them, ie: prototype or function - object pattern

Restrictions:

* The application is to be written in a single index.html file
* Optionally, include a single style.css, scripts.js, and just jQuery (if you really need it) *  no other libraries/frameworks are permitted
* Evaluation Criteria:
* Use of <select multiple> html tag/element for displaying contacts
* Use of objects, ie: some sort of contact object (prototype/function)
* Code efficiency/effectiveness - no duplicate code, fast code
* Quality of code comments and code/syntax structure
* Field validation, ie: telephone, emails, or not filled
* Use of jQuery - or lack thereof - preferred
* Respect of JavaScript language, ie: avoid hoisting
